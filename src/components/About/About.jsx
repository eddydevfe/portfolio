            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, my name is Eduardo, a Brazilian front-end developer
              specializing in React. I focus on building efficient, responsive
              web interfaces with clean, maintainable code.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For as long as I can remember, I thought software development was
              the coolest thing. But never in a million years did I think
              I&apos;d become a developer myself. As I grew older, I realized
              not only is it a viable career path for me, but it&apos;s also one
              of the few I&apos;d be happy to pursue. And here I am, giving it a
              shot.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Letâ€™s see where this road leads. ðŸ™ƒ</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My technical skills include React, Sass, JavaScript, TypeScript,
              CSS, HTML, and some experience with Express.js for back-end
              development.
